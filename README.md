# EmeraldImpulse7
<p>Hi, my name is Impulse. I am a casual programmer, and I code in Node.js and Python. I am also decent at web design.</p>
<p>No, I am not the Impulse from Hermitcraft, stop asking.</p>
<p>I also make cool and stupid stuff for fun, because programming can get boring sometimes.</p>
