Click install, and set up a profile for it.
I would recomend giving the profile a custom directory.
You can then download the mods from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zw1ugswsg3rk87q/AACGcSyJKjkxk4ce-Mf78ZUPa?dl=0.
Then put the mods folder in the custom directory, then you are done!
If you have any questions, ping `Impulse#7647`, aka me.
